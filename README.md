# Hello, world! 👋
My name is Fernanda and I am a software engineering student at [École 42](https://www.42network.org/), at the [42|Rio] (https://42.rio/) campus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

## About me 🌟
I initially graduated in Geology and during my master's research, I faced problems with data scarcity due to the pandemic. To solve this issue, I decided to learn programming and fell in love with it. Since then, I have been pursuing a career in software engineering, hoping to make a difference by creating innovative solutions.
